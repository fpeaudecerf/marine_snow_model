This repository contains the code associated with the theoretical models of marine particle degradation coupled to sinking speed presented in the manuscript:

The files are organised as follows:
- dynamic_laws.py contains all the support functions for computing the particle dynamics and associated fluxes;
- each modelling Figure of the manuscript has its own folder FigureXX. This folder contains a main script generating the figure named FigureXX.py, the generated figure FigureXX.png and potentially ancillary files such as saved fluxes from previous computations and intermediary plots. To re-generate the figure, simply execute with Python the corresponding script;
- params.py, params_Q10.py and params_T.py contain parameter values used for computations and figure generation, and are called by the figure generating scripts;
- utils.py is a small utilities file;

- environment.yml sets the environment for Binder, so that the script can be executed in Binder without the need for local Python installation. 


Access this Binder by clicking the blue badge above or at the following URL:  
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fpeaudecerf/marine_snow_model/HEAD  

There, you can select "New" -> "Terminal" and execute the scripts from there.
