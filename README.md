This repository contains the code associated to the theoretical model of marine particle degradation coupled to sinking speed presented in the manuscript:

"Sinking enhances the degradation of organic particles by marine bacteria",

*Nature Geosciences* (accepted 2021)

The files are organised as follow:
- dynamic_laws.py contains all the support functions for computing the particle dynamics and associated fluxes;
- each modelling Figure of the manuscript has its own folder FigureXX. This folder contains a main script generating the figure named FigureXX.py, the generated figure FigureXX.png and potentially ancillary files such as saved fluxes from previous computations and intermediary plots. To re-generate the figure, simply execute with Python the corresponding script;
- params.py, params_Q10.py and params_T.py contain parameter values used for computations and figure generation, and are called by the figure generating scripts;
- utils.py is a small utilities file;

- environment.yml sets the environment for Binder, so that the script can be executed in Binder without need for local Python installation.
